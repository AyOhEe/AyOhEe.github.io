                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I've always loved computers and everything that surrounds them - From the age of 2, 
                        playing games on my Grandmother's desktop, 
                        having my first exposure to programming in Scratch at the age of 8, 
                        right up to the age of 15, starting my first long-term project.
                        As soon as I could take Computing Science as a subject in High School, I never looked back.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Learning</h2>
                    <h5>Learning has always been a strongsuit of mine. </h5>
                    <p>
                        Whenever there's something new I'd like to learn, 
                        I can simply pick it up and hit the ground running.<br>
                        In my second last year of High School, late September 2022, my Chemistry teacher approached me about participating 
                        in the Royal Society of Chemistry's Olympiad in 2023 - 
                        I jumped at the chance to sink my teeth into something. 
                        Within two months I had finished the entirety of Higher Chemistry,
                        and in the following two months - finishing in the early hours of new year's day - 
                        I had finished the entirety of Advanced Higher Chemistry.<br>
                        Later that month, I would sit the question paper for the RChO.<br>
                        When I got the results back, I had scored 36/85 marks - 
                        <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/rsc-education-news/round-one-results-of-2023-chemistry-olympiad/4017073.article">One mark shy of a Gold award, and narrowly in the top 10% of entrants></a>
                    </p>

                        Just because something isn't on this list doesn't mean I <em>can't</em> use it, it just means I haven't used it <em>yet.</em><br>
                        <br>

                        skill one can have is the ability to learn: If you can learn quick, you can 
                        learn to do anything, and if you can learn to do anything, you can learn to do it well.
